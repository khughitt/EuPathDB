\title{Retrieve GO terms associated with a set of genes.}
\usage{
load_orgdb_go(orgdb)
}
\arguments{
\item{orgdb}{OrganismDb instance.}
}
\value{
Data frame of gene IDs, go terms, and names.
}
\description{
AnnotationDbi provides a reasonably complete set of GO mappings between gene
ID and ontologies.  This will extract that table for a given set of gene
IDs.
}
\details{
This is a nice way to extract GO data primarily because the Orgdb data sets
are extremely fast and flexible, thus by changing the keytype argument, one
may use a lot of different ID types and still score some useful ontology data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 go_terms <- load_go_terms(org, c("a","b"))

I think Keith provided the initial implementation of this, but atb
 messed with it pretty extensively.
